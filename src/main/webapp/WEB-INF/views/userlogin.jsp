			<h1 class="display-4">Voting System</h1>
			<p class="lead">Online voting systems are software platforms used
				to securely conduct votes and elections. As a digital platform, they
				eliminate the need to cast your votes using paper or having to
				gather in person. They also protect the integrity of your vote by
				preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times. Many
				secure voting platform vendors provide supportive vote management
				consulting services that help organizations design and implement
				their voting procedures. These services help organizations save
				time, stick to best practices, and meet internal requirements and/or
				external regulations, such as third-party vote administration needs.</p>
